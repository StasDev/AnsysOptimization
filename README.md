# AnsysOptimization
Optimization of the composite blade with the help simple genetic algorithm
Optimization of the composite blade with the help simple genetic algorithm. Blade layout consists of skin, polymer strengthening in which embedded tuning mass, foam filler and optionally D-spar.
Design variables are geometry parameters of components of the blade.


  Unrealized features:
1. Aeroelastic stability cost function.
2. Surrogate optimization, including selecting plan points for initialization. (New functor which use the class Cost_f)
